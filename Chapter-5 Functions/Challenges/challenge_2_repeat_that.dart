// Challenge 2: Can you repeatthat?
// Write a function named repeatTask with the following
// definition:
// int repeatTask(int times, int input, Function ta
// sk)
// It repeats a given task on input for times number of times.
// Pass an anonymous function to repeatTask to square the
// input of 2 four times. Confirm that you get the result 65536,
// since 2 squared is 4, 4 squared is 16, 16 squared is 256, and
// 256 squared is 65536.
